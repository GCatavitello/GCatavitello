- 👋 Hi, I’m @GCatavitello
- 👀 I’m interested in neurophysiology, neuromechanics and in particular in how we move in different environments and conditions
- 🌱 I’m constantly improving my R and Matlab coding knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects from gait analysis, like gait events recognition, to neuromechanics of locomotion. 
- 📫 You can reach me at giovanna.catavitello@uclouvain.be or on twitter @GionnaCata
- Scientist, Wife and Mother, I fight every day for gender and family equalities. It would be a better word if we all have equal opportunities.
- I love my family, Martial Arts, Music, Food and Nature.
